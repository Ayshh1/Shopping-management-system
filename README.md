# Shopping-management-system using data structures
It is a shopping management system in which i have used data structures like linked list , queue and stack . Two types of login are provided here . One as an administratr and one as a customer .
A list of customers will be generated whenever they will buy a product . All these enlisted using queue (FIFO format)
When the system will be logged in , a trolley with a unique number will be provided from stack of trolleys to each new customer .
Hope you enjoy ! :D
